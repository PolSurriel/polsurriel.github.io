<!-- # Product — presskit.html -->

<!--
  **This is your product or game page**. It should focus on _ONLY_ one product. This is not a replacement for your product's website, but a quick way for the press to know it faster.

  [Check the actual rendered page for the code you'll find below.](http://pixelnest.io/presskit.html/example/product/)

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t product
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  <hr>

  For your company' `data.xml`, [refer to the company documentation](../company/).

  <hr>

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<product>` or `<game>` tag.

  <!-- ## Relations -->

  <!--
    You can specify relations between products using the `<relations>` tag.


    Then, on this page product, you will see a new line in the factsheet:

    ```
    DLC:
    My Super Game: Ultimate Edition
    ```

    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.

    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:

    ```
    DLC of:
    My Super Game
    ```

    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._

    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.

    **Warning**: you need to rebuild the presskit to see the changes.

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- Describe your product here. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    Here goes a quick description of your product or game. Be concise and explain in very few words the concept or the gameplay and why it's really cool and why everyone should use or play it.
  </description>

  <!--
    Tell the story of your product with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<history>` block like in the example.
    - Or use an `<histories>` block if you have tons of things to say.

    You can't have both.

    You can see an example of the `<histories>` block in the company page.
  -->

  <!-- ## About -->

  <!--
    An "About Your Company" section is automatically generated from the content of the company page.

    This <abouts> tag is completely **optional**. If you don't want this section, just delete it. But sometimes, you want to add a description for a partner.

    This is this the place to do it.

    For example, if you have a publisher, you can speak a bit more about it here.

    Most of the time, you should link that to the <partner> tag above, if you want to explain a partner a bit more. But you could use this section for other purpose.

    The <link> tag is optional.
