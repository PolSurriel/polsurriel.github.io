<!--
I've added a little offset to the dropdown menu to improve the UX.
By this way you don't have to move the mouse to the first option.

So you can execute the first option just by double clicking!!

<div id="container" [ngStyle]="{top:yPosition-7+'px', left:xPosition-7 + 'px'}">
    <ul>
        <li *ngFor="let option of options; index as i" (click)="onOptionClicked(i)">{{option}}</li>
    </ul>
</div>
